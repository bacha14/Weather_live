• The project aims to build a desktop weather application where you can 
enter a city and the application will give you accurate information about 
the current weather in the selected city.
• The application was created using python and classic tkinter interface 
along with object-oriented programming.
• We used a specific weather API to receive live information about the 
current weather for a city.
